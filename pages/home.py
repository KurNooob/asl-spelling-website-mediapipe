                Start by defining what ASL is. American Sign Language is a visual language used primarily by the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community in the United States and parts of Canada. Unlike spoken languages, ASL uses hand shapes, facial expressions, body movements, and spatial relationships to convey meaning. It has its own grammar and structure, distinct from English, and is a vital tool for communication in the Deaf community.

For hearing individuals, it helps break down communication barriers with Deaf and Hard of Hearing people. It's also a great skill for personal, professional, and social growth, making workplaces, schools, and communities more inclusive. Furthermore, it can be a fulfilling personal challenge to learn a new language with a different mode of communication.

                By 2050, nearly 2.5 billion people are projected to have some degree of hearing loss, with 700 million requiring hearing rehabilitation. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), over 5% of the worldâ€™s population, or 430 million people, live with disabling hearing loss, including 34 million children. Disabling hearing loss, defined as a loss greater than 35 decibels (dB) in the better ear, is especially prevalent in low- and middle-income countries, where nearly 80% of those affected reside.
